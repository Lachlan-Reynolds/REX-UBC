The Research EXperience program (REX) exposes undergraduates to the research world. By connecting undergraduate students to graduate students or postdoctoral fellows, 
students with no prior experience work on a theoretical research project of their choice. REX allows students to learn from experienced mentors, 
develop their research skills, and present at one of BCâ€™s largest undergraduate research conferences, the Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC).
